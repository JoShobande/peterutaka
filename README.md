## How to contribute to the project
You'll be given a task to perform in the form of the pages to write code for.  
Every page requires HTML and CSS. To write HTML for any page, just create a .html file for the page . 

The HTML files live inside the root folder. Do not create any new folder!  
The CSS files live inside the css folder inside the root folder. You write new CSS by creating a new .css file and importing into the main style.scss file.  

You'll write your CSS using the SCSS syntax.
